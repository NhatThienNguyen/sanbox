# CP1404 Practicals 
## Name: Nhat Thien Nguyen
My name is Nhat Thien Nguyen, and I'm currently learning Python. I quite like it because it easy enough to understand but complex to master. I have learned it about 6 or 7 months by now. This repo is all my practicals for each week, everyone can comment and I can come back to observe the feedback.
- For me clean code is removing any waste part that not necessary.
- All the functions should be reusable without recreate needed.
- The code should have good naming convention, easy to read and observe and easy for other coder to understand.
