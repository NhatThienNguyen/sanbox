# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

It was mostly longer than I estimate.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Personally I think it didn't change much, because as the lesson go, the practical become harder and I have to implement what I just learned so maybe it could improve a bit but not much.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I knew that how much time I should spend on a task and how decide a task difficulty to estimate the time more accuracy

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Honestly, I don't know why no one have reviewed my code, so I don't really have any clear answer regarding this question.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I can learn the way they write the code and I can learn from that, also, sometimes their code have a better solution for the matter than my solution.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 6](https://github.com/WangXiang-815/cp1404practicals/pull/3#event-16990223845)

### Explanation

This is the first time I have done a code reviewed for someone. This guy code is very clean and there are no big error for me have any comment.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 7](https://github.com/BochaoZhang-hub/cp1409practicals/pull/3?notification_referrer_id=NT_kwDOC8brj7UxNTQ1NjUyNTg0ODoxOTc1ODU4MDc#event-17046836458)

### Explanation

This is second time I've done it. This guy code is clean but there are some part he not yet finished when I do review, and there are some parts that I have a better solution, so I help him state it out.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of this subject I would reduce the task number but increase the length of it for complexity, or make more tasks but reduce the length for understanding

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

The only thing I did really well in this subject is I've never submitted task late. Besides that, I really don't know what I did well in this subject.
